How Nutrition Benefits Hair Health Promotes Growth: Hair growth happens from the inside out. Protein-rich foods, for example, provide the amino acids essential for building keratin, the protein that makes up most of our hair.

Strengthens Hair: Nutrients like iron, zinc, and vitamin D contribute to stronger hair strands and prevent brittleness.

Boosts Scalp Health: Vitamins and minerals, especially those in leafy greens and nuts, promote a healthy scalp environment by improving blood flow and oxygen levels, allowing hair follicles to thrive.

Supports Moisture and Elasticity: Healthy fats like omega-3s (found in fish, chia seeds, and walnuts) help keep the hair and scalp moisturized, reducing dryness and breakage.
""";

const kNISH3 =
    """A balanced gut is essential for nutrient absorption. No matter how nutrient-rich your diet is, poor gut health can prevent the body from absorbing the key vitamins and minerals that support hair health.

	• Probiotics: Foods rich in probiotics, such as yogurt, kefir, and kimchi, introduce beneficial bacteria to the gut, which aid in digestion and nutrient absorption.
	
	•	Prebiotics: Foods like bananas, garlic, and onions contain fiber that feeds the beneficial gut bacteria, helping maintain a balanced microbiome.
	
	•	Postbiotics: Postbiotics are the beneficial byproducts produced when prebiotics are fermented by probiotics in the gut. These compounds support immune health and reduce inflammation, which benefits overall hair and scalp health.
""";

	•	Include All Three: Aim to consume a mix of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotic-supportive foods (like fiber-rich vegetables and whole grains) to create a balanced environment in the gut.

• Silicones: Although silicones can lead to buildup, they’re effective for protecting hair in certain situations, like heat styling or exposure to saltwater on a beach holiday.

The scalp is more than just skin covering the skull; it’s where each hair strand is nurtured and where the womb of the hair—the follicle—lies. 

This is the place where the hair is fed through blood flow and where cell division in the dermal papilla starts the journey of every new hair strand. 

Proactive scalp care helps ensure that this environment supports the healthiest hair possible.""";

Just as plants absorb nutrients through soil, hair receives its nutrients through the scalp. The health of each strand is directly linked to the nutrients available in this “feeding soil.”

The scalp houses the hair follicle, the “womb” of each hair strand, where cell division and growth occur. Blood flow brings essential nutrients directly to the follicle, providing the building blocks that allow hair to grow strong.

The food we eat ultimately nourishes the scalp. Poor nutrients result in weak, brittle hair, while a well-balanced diet fortifies hair from within. This is why true hair health relies on internal care as much as external maintenance.""";

Massaging the scalp stimulates blood flow, which brings more nutrients to the follicles and promotes healthier, stronger hair. Massages can be done with fingertips or specialized scalp massagers.

A clean scalp prevents buildup that could clog follicles and inhibit hair growth. Use gentle cleansers, or specific scalp cleansers, that won’t strip the scalp’s natural oils, and consider conditioning treatments to keep it hydrated.

Avoid activities or habits that stress the scalp, as stress can lead to inflammation. Inflammation disrupts the scalp environment, leading to conditions that can hinder healthy hair growth. Manage stress and avoid overly tight hairstyles that may pull at the scalp.""";

Exercise is one of the most effective ways to release endorphins (natural stress relievers). Try incorporating a short walk, yoga, or even light stretching into your day to help reduce tension.

Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them, reducing the mental load and freeing up space for positivity. Try listing three things you’re grateful for each day.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, give yourself permission to step away from stressful activities. Regular breaks—even just five minutes every hour—can help prevent burnout and keep your mind clear.

Try relaxing activities like reading, meditation, or gentle stretching before bed to prepare your mind and body for rest. Eating foods that naturally promote melatonin, such as tart cherries, bananas, or almonds, can support restful sleep and, consequently, hair health.
